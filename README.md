## About the Book
Haskell is a purely functional language that has the great ability to develop large and difficult softwares that are easily maintainable. Haskell Cookbook provides recipes that start by illustrating the principles of functional programming in Haskell, and then gradually build up your expertise in creating industrial strength programs to accomplish any goal.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All the code files are present in their respective code folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
my $a = 10;
my $b = 20;
my $c = 0;
$c = add($a, $b);
say $c; # 30

sub add($a, $b) {
  return $a + $b;
}
```

This book is targeted at readers who wish to learn the Haskell language. If you are a beginner, Haskell Cookbook will get you started. If you are experienced, it will expand your knowledge base. A basic knowledge of programming will be helpful.
